KOOL AID KIDS - THE WARNING
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
There's a traitor in our midst
Somebody's got a mind of their own
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
Remember things are solved through fists
Words will only make things worse
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
Lock the handcuffs on your wrists
Ball and chain around your throat
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
Fill your cup and close the lid
Drink it all 'til you choke
And it's sad to admit it's true
That we find it way too easy, too easy to be cruel
'Cause fear and regret go hand in hand
But that's what it means to be human
A raise of a glass
And we drink, we drink it all again
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
Smile until you are dismissed
Happiness is not a choice
Hey you, Kool-Aid kids
You are never to resist
You belong, you are devoid
And it's sad to admit it's true
Oh, that we find it way too easy, too easy to be cruel
'Cause fear and regret go hand in hand
But that's what it means to be human
A raise of a glass
And we drink, we drink it all again
We drink it all again
Down your cup so we don't drown
Another drink, another round
Down your cup so we don't drown
Another drink, another round
Down your cup so we don't drown
Another drink, another round
Down your cup so we don't drown and we drink
We drink it all again
We drink it all again
We drink it all again
We drink it all again
